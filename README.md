# Hospital Management Database Project

This SQL project focuses on the creation of a hospital management database and implementing various functions using SQL queries. The database is designed to manage the information related to patients, doctors, appointments, medical records, and other relevant entities within a hospital.

## Database Schema
The database schema includes tables for patients, doctors, appointments, medical records, and potentially other entities as required. Each table is structured to store specific attributes related to the respective entity, ensuring data integrity and efficient management.

## Implemented Functions
The project implements several SQL functions to perform various operations on the hospital management database, including but not limited to:

1. **WHERE Clause**: Utilized to filter data based on specific conditions, such as retrieving patient information for a particular age group or doctor details for a specific specialty.
2. **Nested Queries**: Employed to perform complex queries involving subqueries within the main query, enabling tasks like finding doctors with the highest number of appointments or patients with multiple medical records.
3. **Aggregate Functions**: Used for statistical analysis and summarization, such as calculating the average age of patients or finding the total number of appointments made.
4. **JOIN Operations**: Utilize SQL JOIN operations to combine data from multiple tables, enabling tasks like retrieving patient details along with their corresponding doctor information or appointments.
5. **GROUP BY and HAVING Clauses**: Employ GROUP BY and HAVING clauses for grouping data based on specific attributes and applying conditions on grouped data, such as finding the total number of appointments per doctor or identifying doctors with a certain number of patients.
6. **Subqueries**: Extend the use of nested queries to perform more advanced operations, such as finding patients who have never made an appointment or doctors who have not treated any patients.
7. **UPDATE and DELETE Statements**: Implement UPDATE and DELETE statements to modify existing data in the database, such as updating patient records or removing redundant information.

## Usage
To use the hospital management database and execute the implemented functions, follow these steps:

1. **Database Setup**: Create and initialize the database using the provided SQL script or import the database dump file.
2. **SQL Queries**: Execute SQL queries corresponding to the desired function using your preferred SQL client or command-line interface.
3. **Retrieve Results**: Review the results returned by the executed queries to obtain relevant information or insights from the database.

## Project Files
The project may include the following files:

- **Hospital_database.sql**: SQL script to create and initialize the hospital management database schema.
- **SQL_modify_database.sql**: SQL script containing implemented functions using WHERE clause, nested queries, and other SQL features.
- **README.md**: This file providing an overview of the project and instructions for executing the SQL queries.

## Conclusion
This project aims to demonstrate the implementation of a hospital management database and various SQL functions for data manipulation and analysis. By leveraging SQL's capabilities, the project facilitates efficient management of hospital-related information and supports decision-making processes within the healthcare domain.
